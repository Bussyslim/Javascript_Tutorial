## JavaScript Display Possibilities

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

## Using innerHTML

To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.

The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:

Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.

## Using document.write()

For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write()

Note that using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML

The document.write() method should only be used for testing.

## Using window.alert()

You can use an alert box to display data

You can skip the window keyword that is it can also be written like this alert().

In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:

## Using console.log()

The console.log() method is called for debugging purpose.

## JavaScript Print

window.print() method in the browser is call to print the content of the current window.

## JavaScript Statements
Javascript statements are list of javascript instructions found in javascript program.

JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Example
let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
x = 5;          // Statement 2
y = 6;          // Statement 3
z = x + y;      // Statement 4

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

## Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

Examples
let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
e.g
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

although ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.


## JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

let person = "Ronny";
let person="Ronny";

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

let x = y + z;

## JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

Example

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";

## JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

Example
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}


## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed. Below are some Javascript keywords.

Keyword	        Description

var         -   Declares a variable
let         -   Declares a block variable
const       -   Declares a block constant
if          -   Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch      -   Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	        -   Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function    -	  Declares a function
return      -	  Exits a function
try	        -   Implements error handling to a block of statements

JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as variable name.

## JavaScript Syntax
JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

## How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

## How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

## JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

JavaScript Literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

10.50

1001

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

"John Smith"

'John Smith'

## JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

let x;
x = 6;

## JavaScript Operators
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:

(5 + 6) * 10

JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;

## JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:

5 * 10
Expressions can also contain variable values:

x * 10
The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, "John" + " " + "Smith", evaluates to "John Smith":

"John" + " " + "Smith"

## JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:

let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;

The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;

In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result.


## JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

let x = 5;   // This will be executed

// x = 6;   This will NOT be executed


## JavaScript Identifiers / Names

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Note
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:

let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

## JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

## JavaScript Character Set
JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

## JavaScript Comments
JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

## Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

## This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:

Example
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

## This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:

Example
let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

## This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

It is most common to use single line comments.
Block comments are often used for formal documentation.

## Using Comments to Prevent Execution
Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.

## This example uses // to prevent execution of one of the code lines:

Example
//document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

## This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of multiple lines:

Example
/*
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
*/
